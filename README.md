## files

### llaves-pgp 
manage gpg keys
inspired by [gpg-tui](https://github.com/orhun/gpg-tui)

### nf-dl
based on [getnf](https://github.com/ronniedroid/getnf)

### gitto
was the very first to be created, I didnt know the existence of `forgit` or `git-fuzzy` (just to mention few of them). The only I don't actively use

### packend
apt-get front end 
In the same line like [fuzzypkg](https://github.com/zdykstra/fuzzypkg)

### gestor-usuarios
just to quickly manage users and groups on local and server

### servicios
